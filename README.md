# nodechat

## Work in progress

### TODO:

- [] Redo color schemes and styling overall, it's hideous
- [] Fix the user settings sidepanel to actually allow changing the nickname
- [] Set up a chat settings panel. Room creator/admin should be able to rename or delete room. Guests should be able to leave room.
- [] Actually implement registration. 
  - [] Create a default nickname
  - [] Add new user to the global chatroom by default
- [] Implement actual chatroom admin functionality
