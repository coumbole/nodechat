# nodechat

## Installation


## Work in progress

### Known bugs
- [] New chatrooms don't have chat icons
- [] Issues with displaying the nickname correctly in the settings panel when changing it


### TODO:

- [] Redo color schemes and styling overall, it's hideous
- [] Implement better error handling (Other than just showing the error message on the console)
- [] Implement actual chatroom admin functionality
